        <li>Isaac Newton (born December 25, 1642 [January 4, 1643, New Style], Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, England—died March 20 [March 31], 1727, London)</li>
        <li>His pioneering book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), first published in 1687, consolidated many previous results and established classical mechanics.[8][9]</li>
        <li> His work on light was collected in his highly influential book Opticks, published in 1704.</li>
        <li>Politically and personally tied to the Whig party, Newton served two brief terms as Member of Parliament for the University of Cambridge, in 1689–1690 and 1701–1702. </li>
        <li>He was knighted by Queen Anne in 1705 and spent the last three decades of his life in London, serving as Warden (1696–1699) and Master (1699–1727) of the Royal Mint, as well as president of the Royal Society (1703–1727).</li>
        <li>His work on the subject, usually referred to as fluxions or calculus, seen in a manuscript of October 1666, is now published among Newton's mathematical papers</li>
        <li>His work De analysi per aequationes numero terminorum infinitas, sent by Isaac Barrow to John Collins in June 1669, was identified by Barrow in a letter sent to Collins that August as the work "of an extraordinary genius and proficiency in these things"</li>
        <li>In 1666, Newton observed that the spectrum of colours exiting a prism in the position of minimum deviation is oblong, even when the light ray entering the prism is circular, which is to say, the prism refracts different colours by different angles.[53][54] This led him to conclude that colour is a property intrinsic to light – a point which had, until then, been a matter of debate.</li>
        <li>In late 1668,[61] he was able to produce this first reflecting telescope. It was about eight inches long and it gave a clearer and larger image</li>
        <li>In 1704, Newton published Opticks, in which he expounded his corpuscular theory of light.</li>
        <li>In 1710, Newton found 72 of the 78 "species" of cubic curves and categorised them into four types.</li>
        <li>In the 1690s, Newton wrote a number of religious tracts dealing with the literal and symbolic interpretation of the Bible.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Newton was the greatest genius who ever lived, and once added that Newton was also "the most fortunate, for we cannot find more than once a system of the world to establish.</p>
